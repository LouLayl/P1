Project 1

P1RScript
        The code I made and used to prepare the data and make the graph. You will see in the code multiple    different tables being formed in order understand the dataset and to make the table of data              represented by the final graph: heart_hyper, stroke_summary, hypertension, heartdisease. The table used to make the visualisation is titled percentage_graph.
